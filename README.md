# Project Euler Solutions

## Description

These are some of my solutions to the first ten [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/) problems in C, Clojure, Haskell, and Ruby. Probably not the fanciest or the most performant, but they get the job done. More problems/languages probably on the way at some point.
