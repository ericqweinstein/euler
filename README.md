# Project Euler Solutions

## Description
These are some of my solutions to the first ten [Project Euler](http://www.projecteuler.net/) problems in C, Clojure, Haskell, and Ruby.

If you have the appropriate dependencies installed, you can test the Clojure solutions with `lein test` and the Ruby ones with `rspec --color --format d euler_spec.rb`.
